1. Install any Apache and MySQL server. (Note: XAMPP is a good option that comes as a bundle and is compatible with all major OS: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. Create a virtual host and put all the files from this repository at the root of this new virtual host. Example URL: http://pathwi.se
3. Configure and run it on SSL. You may use self-signed local certificates for the dev setups. You may also configure the host to auto-redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Example URL with SSL: https://pathwi.se
4. Create a database named "pathwise_prototype" with a username of 'root' and password ''. A copy of these details can be found in validate/index.php, lines 32-35. (Please reach out to Anis for a demo database that can be imported and has some dummy data ready.)
5. Update the misty_IP variable in assets/robot-play.js (or any other dependent extensions of the project where we need the Robot IP) with the appropriate robot IP. (Note: This step makes the robot play generated audio for Google TTS or speak on the go. You may also need to configure the speech parameters to make it sound more human-like if you want to use "speak on the go.")
6. That completes the system setup with all dependencies. You may now open the teacher's side of the editor (i.e., https://pathwi.se/index-working.htm or the other virtual host URL from Step 2 if you choose so), make annotations as you see fit, and save them. The student-facing versions (https://pathwi.se/student-robot.htm & https://pathwi.se/student-computer.htm) fetch the latest data from your most recent saves.
